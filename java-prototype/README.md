# MemoryAider

MemoryAider contains Directed Acyclic Graph data structure.
<br/>
Root: Node1, Node2, Node3

Node1: Node4, Node5

Node2: Node5, Node6

Each node comes with list of children

One node can have multiple parents.

HashMap<String, MemoryNode> to keep track of the nodes

Start the program, construct the MemoryGraph structure

Load the MemoryLeaves. For each node, update the total ChildLeave
